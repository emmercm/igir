            Thank you for your first pull request, ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}! If you haven't yet, please familiarize yourself with `igir`'s [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/emmercm/igir/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

            Some GitHub Actions CI workflows may not automatically run for you due to [security best practices](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#controlling-changes-from-forks-to-workflows-in-public-repositories), so a maintainer may need to manually approve the workflows to run. As a result, it is important to make sure tests pass locally before submitting a pull request to help ensure a fast review. Thank you!
