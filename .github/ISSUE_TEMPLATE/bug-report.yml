      description: |

  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Debug logs
      description: |
        The debug logs of your command run with the `-vvv` option. This is _not_ just a copy of the standard progress bar CLI output.

        You can redirect the CLI output of Igir to a file with the syntax: `igir [commands..] [options] -vvv > igir.log`. You can then attach this file in the GitHub text editor.

        This field is _not_ optional as it is one of the most important ways to gain insight into your unique scenario. Without this information it is difficult to reproduce your problem.
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: input
    attributes:
      label: DAT(s) used
      description: |
        Links to the DATs that were used for this Igir command, if any.

    validations:

  - type: input
    attributes:
      label: Node.js version
      description: |
        What version of Node.js are you running? This can be seen with the `node --version` command.

        You can specify "N/A" when using a standalone version of Igir (one downloaded from GitHub).
