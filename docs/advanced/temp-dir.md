# Temp Directory

`igir` needs to write some temporary files to disk for a few reasons:

- Downloading [DAT URLs](../dats/processing.md#scanning-for-dats) to disk before parsing
- Extracting [some archives](../input/reading-archives.md) to disk during scanning, and when reading when extracting or [zipping](../output/writing-archives.md)

Temporary files are ones that are deleted as soon as `igir` no longer needs them for processing. `igir` will also delete any leftover temporary files on exit.

`igir` will use your operating system's temporary directory for these files by default.  The option `--temp-dir <path>` is provided to let you change the directory, and you may want to do this for a few reasons:

- Your operating system drive has minimal space available
- You want to protect your operating system drive from excess wear and tear
- You want to use a "RAM disk" instead of a real drive

## RAM disks

### :simple-windowsxp: Windows

There are no tools built-in to Windows that can create a RAM disk. The open source [ImDisk Toolkit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/imdisk-toolkit/) is a popular option.

### :simple-apple: macOS

The built-in `diskutil` and `hdiutil` tools can be used to create and mount a RAM disk. Alex T has some instructions in a [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/htr3n/344f06ba2bb20b1056d7d5570fe7f596).

### :simple-linux: Linux

`tmpfs` is a tool that comes with most Linux distributions that is used for creating RAM disks. Oracle has [a guide](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18752_01/html/817-5093/fscreate-99040.html) on the tool.
