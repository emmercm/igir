# RomM

[RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) is a web based ROM management solution that allows you to scan, enrich, and browse your game collection with a clean and responsive interface. With support for multiple platforms, various naming schemes and custom tags, RomM is a must-have for anyone who plays on emulators.

## ROMs

RomM uses its own [proprietary ROM folder structure](https://github.com/rommapp/romm/wiki/Supported-Platforms), so `igir` has a replaceable `{romm}` token to sort ROMs into the right place. See the [replaceable tokens page](../../output/tokens.md) for more information.
