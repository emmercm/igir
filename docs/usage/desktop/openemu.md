# OpenEmu

[OpenEmu](https://openemu.org/) is a launcher for various emulators for macOS. It differs from many other desktop frontends in that it is _not_ based off of [RetroArch](retroarch.md)/Libretro.

    OpenEmu has its own ROM importing mechanism that copies files to `~/Library/Application Support/OpenEmu/Game Library/roms` and adds them to a database. OpenEmu will _not_ automatically scan files you place into this folder, so `igir` is unable to help sort them.
