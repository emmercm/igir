# MinUI

[MinUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI/) is a custom launcher supporting the Powkiddy RGB30, Trimui Smart (and Pro), Miyoo Mini (and Plus), as well as Anbernic RG35XX. It is focused on providing a minimalistic and easy to use frontend for the most important 8 and 16 bit consoles.

## BIOS Files

MinUI is strictly *bring your own BIOS*. You can find information on the required BIOS files [here](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI/blob/main/skeleton/EXTRAS/README.txt)

## ROMs

MinUI supports many many systems and ROM formats. Check the folders [here (base)](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI/tree/main/skeleton/BASE/Roms) and [here (extras)](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI/tree/main/skeleton/EXTRAS/Roms) for a comprehensive list about the indivudual systems. Most supported systems and their ROMS can be automatically sorted by `igir` using the `{minui}` output token. See the [replaceable tokens page](../../output/tokens.md) for more information.

MinUI uses the names unter /Roms on the SD card in a more creative way than most other frontends. The folder names consist of a *UI name* and a *PAK name*. The *UI name* is used as the name shown in the User interface as a list item name, while the *PAK name* controls which software pack is used to open the files within. Files with the same *UI name* but different *PAK name* are listed in the same list in the UI but are opened with different PAKs. `igir` uses the vendor recommendations for the folder names with some exceptions.

MinUI requires multi-file releases to be grouped into subdirectories (bin/cue releases of the PS1 for example). It is recommended to use the [`--dir-game-subdir multiple` option](../../output/path-options.md), which is the default at this time.

More details about these features can be found [here](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI/tree/main/skeleton/BASE) under the sections `Roms` and `Disc-based games`.

    Replace the `E:\` drive letter with wherever your SD card is:

      --input ROMs\ ^
      --output "E:\roms\{minui}" ^
      --dir-letter ^
      --no-bios
    ```

      --input ROMs/ \
      --output "/Volumes/MinUI/roms/{minui}" \
