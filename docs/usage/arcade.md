# Arcade ROM Sets

Building a ROM set that works with the _exact_ version of your arcade emulator is necessarily complicated, and the terminology is confusing.

This page is written to give users just enough context to build & re-build arcade ROM sets. [MAME](https://docs.mamedev.org/usingmame/aboutromsets.html), [MAMEWorld](https://easyemu.mameworld.info/mameguide/getting_started/about_roms.html), [Pleasuredome](https://pleasuredome.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page), [RetroArch](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/arcade-getting-started), and [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Validating%2C-Rebuilding%2C-and-Filtering-ROM-Collections/?h=merge#validating-and-rebuilding-roms) are great resources to read more about the nuances of arcade emulation & ROM sets.

!!! warning

    People often shorthand all arcade emulation as "MAME," but there are other modern and actively maintained arcade emulators such as [FinalBurn Neo](https://github.com/finalburnneo/FBNeo). Different emulators have different needs, so it's important to understand what emulator and what version you're using.

## Emulator versions & DATs

Unlike traditional console emulators that only have to emulate a small set of hardware, arcade emulators have the monumental task of emulating a wildly varying number of hardware chips, inputs, and outputs. This results in each version of an emulator having a very specific set of games it can emulate, and newer emulator versions will likely add more games to this set.

Due to arcade machines being more complicated and rarer than games for home consoles, arcade ROM dumps are sometimes imperfect. Because of this, newer emulator versions may expect different ROM files than older versions. This makes ROM sets potentially incompatible between different emulator versions.

Because of all of these reasons, each arcade emulator version usually comes with a companion [DAT](../dats/introduction.md#arcade-dats) that details the _exact_ set of ROM files supported by that _exact_ emulator version. Emulators such as [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/) take this a step further and expect an _exact_ zip file name for each game.

    tl;dr each arcade emulator version has an _exact_ DAT file you need to use to sort your ROMs or your games may not work!

## Finding DATs

## ROM set types

There are three broadly accepted types of ROM sets, with one extra variation, resulting in four types.

First, you will want to read up on [parent/clone](../dats/introduction.md#parentclone-pc-dats) sets and how DATs catalog them.

Here is a comparison chart:

"Split" makes a great choice with its tradeoff of high compatibility with emulator frontends while also saving disk space.

"Full non-merged" makes a great choice when you only care about a very limited set of games.

The ROM merge type can be specified with the `--merge-roms <type>` option:

=== ":simple-windowsxp: Windows"

    ```batch
    igir copy zip ^
      --dat "mame0258b_64bit.exe" ^
      --input <input> ^
      --output <output> ^
      --merge-roms split
    ```

=== ":simple-apple: macOS"

    ```shell
    igir copy zip \
      --dat "mame0258-x86/mame" \
      --input <input> \
      --output <output> \
      --merge-roms split
    ```

=== ":simple-linux: Linux"

    ```shell
    igir copy zip \
      --dat "$(which "mame")" \
      --input <input> \
      --output <output> \
      --merge-roms split
    ```

## Example: building a new ROM set

Let's say we want to build an arcade ROM set that's compatible with the most recent version of [RetroArch](desktop/retroarch.md). The steps would look like this:

1. **Determine which arcade emulator we want to use.**

    Let's say we want to use MAME, for its high accuracy.

2. **Determine the arcade emulator's version.**

    After downloading and loading the "Arcade (MAME - Current)" core in the RetroArch UI, the footer of the "core information" menu says the MAME version is "MAME (0.258 (b6d4105ea))".

3. **Locate or download the emulator version's DAT.**

   [progetto-SNAPS](https://www.progettosnaps.net/dats/MAME/) provides a mirror of mostly unaltered MAME ListXMLs, so we'll download the 0.258 (August 30, 2023) DAT from it.

4. **Obtain a set of arcade ROM files.**

    This is left as an exercise for the reader.

5. **Determine what kind of ROM set we want.**

    Let's say we care first and foremost that the arcade games "just work," and then we would like to conserve disk space. A "split" ROM set makes a good choice because RetroArch should be able to automatically index every game, including both parents and clones.

6. **Run `igir`.**

  !!! note

      Most arcade emulators expect games to be in zip files, so it is important to specify the `igir zip` command.

  After determining where we want to put our ROMs, we can build our MAME v0.258 ROM set like this:

  === ":simple-windowsxp: Windows (64-bit)"

      ```batch
      igir copy zip ^
        --dat "MAME_Dats_258\DATs\MAME 0.258.dat" ^
        --input "MAME-ROMs\" ^
        --output C:\RetroArch-Win64\roms\MAME-0.258 ^
        --merge-roms split
      ```

  === ":simple-windowsxp: Windows (32-bit)"

      ```batch
      igir copy zip ^
        --dat "MAME_Dats_258\DATs\MAME 0.258.dat" ^
        --input "MAME-ROMs\" ^
        --output C:\RetroArch-Win32\roms\MAME-0.258 ^
        --merge-roms split
      ```

  === ":simple-apple: macOS"

      ```shell
      igir copy zip \
        --dat "MAME_Dats_258/DATs/MAME 0.258.dat" \
        --input "MAME-ROMs/" \
        --output ~/Documents/RetroArch/roms/MAME-0.258 \
        --merge-roms split
      ```

  === ":simple-linux: Linux"

      ```shell
      igir copy zip \
        --dat "MAME_Dats_258/DATs/MAME 0.258.dat" \
        --input "MAME-ROMs/" \
        --output ~/Documents/RetroArch/roms/MAME-0.258 \
        --merge-roms split
      ```

## Example: re-building a ROM set

Most other ROM managers use the terms "re-build" & "fix" when talking about taking an existing set of arcade ROMs, a different emulator version's DAT, and using that DAT to perform an in-place rename of the ROM files. You can think about this as "upgrading" or "downgrading" your ROM set to work with a different emulator version.

!!! note

    A game's required ROM files may change between emulator versions. This usually occurs when bad ROM dumps are replaced with better dumps. `igir` cannot magically deal with these ROM differences, and `igir` will only write complete ROM sets, so you may see games disappear when re-building. You will need to source the differing ROM files in order to keep your full game set.

A major reason `igir` was created was to help disambiguate what it means to build & re-build ROM sets. `igir` explicitly requires users to choose whether ROM files are copied or moved, so that users know what decision they are making. To "re-build" a ROM set, a user just needs to `igir move` ROMs from an input directory to the same directory specified again as the output.

Taking the MAME v0.258 set we created above, let's say we want to "downgrade" it to MAME 2003 (v0.78) because an under-powered device requires it. The steps would look like this:

1. **Locate or download the emulator version's DAT.**

   [progetto-SNAPS](https://www.progettosnaps.net/dats/MAME/) provides a mirror of mostly unaltered MAME ListXMLs, so we'll download the 0.78 (December 25, 2003) DAT from it.

2. **Optional: obtain a set of the arcade ROM files that MAME v0.78 needs that v0.258 doesn't have.**

   These are sometimes called "rollback" sets.

   This is left as an exercise for the reader.

3. **Run `igir`.**

  === ":simple-windowsxp: Windows (64-bit)"

      ```batch
      igir copy zip ^
        --dat "MAME Dats 0.78\MAME 078.dat" ^

        --input "MAME-0.78-Rollback\" ^
        --output C:\RetroArch-Win64\roms\MAME-0.78 ^
        --merge-roms split
      ```

## Building other ROM sets

Sometimes people have a need to build very specific sets. Here are some instructions on how you would build them.

### BIOS set

Build a set of only BIOS files, with each in its own `.zip` file:

=== ":simple-windowsxp: Windows"

    ```batch
    igir copy zip ^
      --dat "MAME_Dats_258\DATs\MAME 0.258.dat" ^
      --input "MAME-ROMs\" ^
      --output "MAME-BIOS\" ^
      --only-bios
    ```

=== ":simple-apple: macOS"

    ```shell
    igir copy zip \
      --dat "MAME_Dats_258/DATs/MAME 0.258.dat" \
      --input "MAME-ROMs/" \
      --output "MAME-BIOS/" \
      --only-bios
    ```

=== ":simple-linux: Linux"

    ```shell
    igir copy zip \
      --dat "MAME_Dats_258/DATs/MAME 0.258.dat" \
      --input "MAME-ROMs/" \
      --output "MAME-BIOS/" \
      --only-bios
    ```

### Device set

Build a set of only device files, with each in its own `.zip` file:

=== ":simple-windowsxp: Windows"

    ```batch
    igir copy zip ^
      --dat "MAME_Dats_258\DATs\MAME 0.258.dat" ^
      --input "MAME-ROMs\" ^
      --output "MAME-Devices\" ^
      --only-device
    ```

=== ":simple-apple: macOS"

    ```shell
    igir copy zip \
      --dat "MAME_Dats_258/DATs/MAME 0.258.dat" \
      --input "MAME-ROMs/" \
      --output "MAME-Devices/" \
      --only-device
    ```

=== ":simple-linux: Linux"

    ```shell
    igir copy zip \
      --dat "MAME_Dats_258/DATs/MAME 0.258.dat" \
      --input "MAME-ROMs/" \
      --output "MAME-Devices/" \
      --only-device
    ```
