`igir` (pronounced "eager") is a platform-independent ROM collection manager to help sort collections and make one game, one rom (1G1R) sets.

## What does `igir` do?

A video of an example use case:

With a large ROM collection it can be difficult to:

- Organize ROM files by console and name
- Delete duplicate ROMs
- Delete ROMs for languages you don't understand
- Consistently name ROM files
- Consistently archive ROMs
- Know what ROMs are missing

`igir` helps solve all of these problems!

## How does `igir` work?

`igir` needs two sets of files:

1. ROMs, including ones with [headers](https://no-intro.org/faq.htm)
2. One or more DATs ([see below](#what-are-dats) for where to download)

Many different input archive types are supported for both ROMs and DATs: .001, .7z, .bz2, .gz, .rar, .tar, .tgz, .xz, .z, .z01, .zip, .zipx, and more!

`igir` then needs one or more commands:

- `copy`: copy ROMs from input directories to an output directory
- `move`: move ROMs from input directories to an output directory
- `zip`: create zip archives of output ROMs
- `test`: test all written ROMs for accuracy
- `clean`: recycle all unknown files in an output directory
- `report`: generate a report on ROMs found and processed

## How do I run `igir`?

With [![Node.js](https://badgen.net/npm/node/igir?icon=nodejs)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, run from the command line:

```shell
npx igir@latest [commands..] [options]
```

Here is the full `igir --help` message which shows all available options and a number of common use case examples:

## What are DATs?

DATs are catalogs of every known ROM per system. A number of different release groups maintain these catalogs, the most popular are:

- [No-Intro P/C XML](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=download&s=64&op=daily) (cartridge-based systems)
  - Note: you can download every console at once from the [daily page](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=download&s=64&op=daily), but you need to manually select "P/C XML" from the dropdown
- [Redump](http://redump.org/downloads/) (optical media-based systems)

And some less popular release groups are:

- [ADVANsCEne](https://www.advanscene.com/html/dats.php) (GBA, DS, 3DS, PSP)
- [TOSEC](https://www.tosecdev.org/downloads/category/22-datfiles)

These catalogs help `igir` distinguish known ROM files in input directories from other files and helps generate reports on ROM collections.

`igir` can currently process DAT files in the XML format only.

## How do I obtain ROMs?

Emulators are generally legal, as long as they don't include copyrighted software such as a system BIOS.

Downloading ROM files that you do not own is piracy and is illegal in many countries. Here are some ways you can legally create ROM files from games you own:

- Nintendo - 3DS: [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9)
- Nintendo - DS, DSi: [GodMode9i](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i)
- Nintendo - Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance: [INLretro Dumper](https://www.infiniteneslives.com/inlretro.php), [Retrode](https://www.retrode.com/) (with an adapter), [GB Operator](https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator)
- Nintendo - Gamecube: [CleanRip](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/CleanRip) (with a Wii)
- Nintendo - Nintendo 64: [INLretro Dumper](https://www.infiniteneslives.com/inlretro.php), [Retrode](https://www.retrode.com/) (with an adapter)
- Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System, Famicom: [INLretro Dumper](https://www.infiniteneslives.com/inlretro.php)
- Nintendo - Super Nintendo: [INLretro Dumper](https://www.infiniteneslives.com/inlretro.php), [Retrode](https://www.retrode.com/)
- Nintendo - Wii: [CleanRip](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/CleanRip)
- Sega - Genesis / Mega Drive: [INLretro Dumper](https://www.infiniteneslives.com/inlretro.php), [Retrode](https://www.retrode.com/)
- Sega - Master System: [Retrode](https://www.retrode.com/) (with an adapter)
- Sega - Saturn: [ImgBurn](https://ninite.com/ImgBurn/) (with a PC)
- Sony - Playstation 1: [ImgBurn](https://ninite.com/ImgBurn/) (with a PC)
- Sony - Playstation 2: [ImgBurn](https://ninite.com/ImgBurn/) (with a PC)

## Why choose `igir`?

There a few different popular ROM managers that have similar features:

- [clrmamepro](https://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/)
- [Romcenter](http://www.romcenter.com/)
- [Romulus](https://romulus.cc/)
- [RomVault](https://www.romvault.com/)

Each manager has its own pros, but most share the same cons:

- Windows-only (sometimes with Wine support), making management on macOS and Linux difficult
- Limited CLI support, making batching and repeatable actions difficult
- UIs that don't clearly state what actions can, will, or are being performed
- Required proprietary database setup step
- Limited or nonexistent archive extraction support
- Limited or nonexistent ROM header support
- Limited or nonexistent parent/clone, region, language, version, and ROM type filtering
- Limited or nonexistent priorities when creating a 1G1R set
- Limited or nonexistent folder management options
- Limited or nonexistent report-only modes
